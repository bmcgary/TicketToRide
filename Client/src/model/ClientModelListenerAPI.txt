-Login Controllers listeners-
    "server:Login", "server:Register", "server:ForgotUserNameOrPassword":
        These do not touch the model at all. Look at the universal API for documentation on these.


-DO NOT listen for these-
    "Logout":
        The model handles this by clearing the model and switching to the Login Menu.

    "StartGame", "CreateGame", "JoinGame", "SendClientModelInformation":
        Each of these commands, if successful will be followed by an Update game command.
        It they are not successful, the modelFacade will alert you.

    "GetLeaderboards", "AddAI", "LeaveGame", "SendChat":
        These commands are still not implemented.

-Lobby Controller commands (Not currently being used)-
    "model:UpdateJoinableGames":

    "model:UpdateGame":

    "model:UpdateUserGames":


-Game Controller commands-
    "model:PublicClientModelInformation", "model:PrivateClientModelInformation":
        These commands are used to initially load each of the game models with data about the current game.

    "model:BuyRoute", "model:DrawTrainCard", "model:NotifyDestinationRouteCompleted", "model:SelectDestinations":
        These commands all send back the latest version of the model contained in a ModelContainer. See the Model Design
        for a quick reference of each of the getters that you can use.

    "model:GetDestinations":
        This command also sends a ModelContainer, and contained in that container is a temp variable holding the list of
        cards.

    "model:GameEnded":
        The modelFacade method for this command still needs to be implemented, but it also return a ModelContainer with
        a temp variable with the information to display that you can access.

    "model:SetGameInView":
        All the game controllers should listen to this. This is called when a player switches games.
